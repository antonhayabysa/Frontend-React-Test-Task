# Test Task Project

This project was created as a test task and demonstrates the following functionality:

1. **Creating a Matrix:**

   - A matrix of `MxN` is created.
   - Each cell in the matrix contains an object with a unique `id` and `amount`, which is a random number.

2. **Increasing Cell Value:**

   - The `amount` in a cell is increased by 1 when the cell is clicked.

3. **Calculating Sum and Average:**

   - The sum of each row and the average of each column are calculated and displayed in the table.

4. **Highlighting Cells:**
   - `X` cells with the `amount` closest to the clicked cell are highlighted.
